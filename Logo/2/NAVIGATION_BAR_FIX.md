# Navigation Bar Logo - Blended Design Fix

## Problem
The navigation bar logo looked like a "cutout" and didn't blend well with scroll movement.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Translucent Navigation Bar ✅
**Changed from:** Solid `Color(.systemBackground)`  
**Changed to:** `.ultraThinMaterial` (blur effect)

This makes the navigation bar:
- Blend smoothly with content underneath
- Adapt to the scrolling content's color
- Feel more integrated and native to iOS

**Code:** [ScrollOffLogoView.swift:56](../../ScrollOff/UI/Components/ScrollOffLogoView.swift#L56)

### 2. Adaptive Dark Mode Logo ✅
Created two versions of the horizontal logo:

**Light Mode:**
- Icon: Teal gradient (#1DC0BF → #0B7F95)
- Text: Teal (#1DC0BF)
- Files: `scrolloff-primary-horizontal.png` (@1x, @2x, @3x)

**Dark Mode:**
- Icon: Brighter teal gradient (#2DD4D3 → #1A9FB0)
- Text: White (#FFFFFF)
- Files: `scrolloff-primary-horizontal-dark.png` (@1x, @2x, @3x)

### 3. High-Resolution PNGs ✅
Converted SVG to PNG for guaranteed rendering:
- @1x: 1000×240px
- @2x: 2000×480px
- @3x: 3000×720px

All with transparent backgrounds for seamless blending.

## Result

The navigation bar now:
- ✅ Blurs and adapts to content underneath
- ✅ Shows full "ScrollOff" text with icon
- ✅ Automatically switches between light/dark variants
- ✅ Feels integrated with scroll movement
- ✅ Maintains visual hierarchy

## Files Updated
- `ScrollOffLogoView.swift` - Navigation bar blur effect
- `LogoPrimaryHorizontal.imageset/Contents.json` - Dark mode support
- PNG files for both light and dark modes

## Test
Build and run the app. The navigation bar should now feel integrated with the content, not like a separate cutout!
