# Privacy Policy for ScrollOff

**Last Updated: November 25, 2025**

## Overview

ScrollOff is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the ScrollOff iOS application.

## Data Collection

**ScrollOff does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

All app data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. We have no access to your data, and your data never leaves your device.

## Information Stored Locally on Your Device

ScrollOff stores the following information locally on your iOS device:

- **Time balance data**: Your earned and spent focus time
- **Blocked apps list**: Apps you've chosen to block
- **Usage statistics**: Focus patterns and streaks (stored locally, never transmitted)
- **App preferences**: Your settings and configurations
- **Focus Challenge history**: Your participation in focus challenges
- **No-Go Zone schedules**: Your configured blocking schedules

This data is stored exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third party.

## Apple Services

ScrollOff uses the following Apple-provided services:

### Screen Time API
ScrollOff uses Apple's Screen Time API to monitor and block apps. All monitoring happens locally on your device. No usage data is transmitted to us or any third party.

### StoreKit (In-App Purchases)
If you purchase a subscription or consumable item (emergency tokens), the transaction is processed entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not collect or store your payment information. Apple's privacy policy governs how your purchase data is handled.

### Local Notifications
ScrollOff sends local notifications (peek expiration alerts, balance reminders) directly on your device. These notifications do not involve any external servers.

## Third-Party Services

ScrollOff does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. There are:
- No analytics SDKs
- No crash reporting services
- No advertising networks
- No social media integrations
- No backend servers

## Face ID / Touch ID

If you enable biometric authentication, ScrollOff uses Apple's Face ID or Touch ID to secure app access. Biometric data is processed entirely by iOS and never leaves your device. We do not have access to your biometric information.

## Data Backup

If you use iCloud Backup, your locally stored ScrollOff data may be included in your device backup according to Apple's iCloud terms. This is controlled by your iOS backup settings, not by ScrollOff.

## Data Deletion

To delete all your ScrollOff data:
1. Delete the ScrollOff app from your device
2. All locally stored data will be permanently removed

Alternatively, you can:
- Manually remove blocked apps from your list
- Reset your time balance in Settings
- Clear your usage history

## Children's Privacy

ScrollOff does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since we collect no data at all, the app is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

**Summary**: ScrollOff is a privacy-first app. We don't collect, transmit, or store any of your data. Everything stays on your device. We have no servers, no tracking, and no third-party services. Your focus time is yours alone.
